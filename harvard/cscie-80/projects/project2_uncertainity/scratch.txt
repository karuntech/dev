Notes to make sense of the problem.

1. Each person carries 0, 1 or 2 genes <-- this is the hidden state
    For example, the probability distribution:
    P(gene=0) = 0.96
    P(gene=1) = 0.03
    P(gene=2) = 0.01
    P(gene) = <0.96, 0.03, 0.01>

2. Each person has a trait or no trait <-- This is something we can observe (evidence)
    For example, the probability distribution
    P(trait=yes) = 0.2
    P(trait=no) = 0.8
    P(trait) = <0.2, 0.8>
    
    It turns out that the trait depends on the number of genes.
    P(trait | gene=0) = <0.01, 0.99>
    P(trait | gene=1) = <0.56, 0.44>
    P(trait | gene=2) = <0.65, 0.35>

    So, to caluclate the probability of someone showing the trait, is pretty straight forward
    just get it from the given probablities IF THE GENES ARE UNCONDITIONAL
    P(trait=yes and gene=0) + P(trait=yes and gene=1) + P(trait=yes, gene=2)
    P(traint=no and gene=0) + P(traint=no and gene=1) + P(trait=no, gene=2)
    To normalize, multiply the distribution propotionally so that they sum up to 1.
    alpha<x, y> => <X,Y>

3. A child inherits one gene from each parent
    If a parent has two genes, he/she will pass one gene with 100% probability
    If a parent has one gene, he/she will pass one gene with 50% probability
    If a parent has no genes, he/she will pass one gene with 0% probability (i.e he/she will not pass the gene)

    In addition, there is a probability of 1% mutation which will inverse the state of the gene
    i.e change from a version of the gene that causes hearing impairment to a version that doesn't and vice versa.

    How to do you combine both the parent's gene are are passed?
    Consider this example:
    Lily has 0 genes
    James has 2 genes
    Harry is their son. What is the probability that Harry will receive one gene?

    Everyone recieves one gene from each parent.
    So, Harry can get one from Lily AND not from James OR one from James AND none from Lily 
    Lily has 0 genes, probabilty of her passing the gene is 0. But there is a 1% mutation chance.
    So, probabilty of Lily passing the gene (so that Harry can have one) is .01.
    What is the probability of James not passing one?
    Since Jameas has 2 genes, he will pass one to Harry with 100% probability. With 1% mutation (.01), harry will
    not recieve anything. So, 1 * .01 = .01.
    So, the probability of Harry receiving 1 gene in this senario (one from Lily and none from James) is .01 * .01

    Probablity of Lily not passing one to Harry: 100% chance that Lilly will not pass it, and there is 99% chance that 
    it will not mutate. So, 1 * .99 = .99. James has two. So, there is 100% chance that he will pass 1, and 99% chance
    that it will not muatate. So, 1 * .99 = .99. So, the probability of LIly not passing and James passing one is .99 * .99

    The probability of Lily passing and James not passing OR Lily not passing and James passing = (.01 * .01) + (.99 *.99) = .99

    Note that this is just one scenario. To compuete P(gene=1) for Harry, we need to compuete:
    P(gene=1 and Lily=0 and James=0) + P(gene=1 and Lily=1 and James=0)...and so on

    Consider this people dictionary (based on family0.csv)
{
  'Harry': {'name': 'Harry', 'mother': 'Lily', 'father': 'James', 'trait': None},
  'James': {'name': 'James', 'mother': None, 'father': None, 'trait': True},
  'Lily': {'name': 'Lily', 'mother': None, 'father': None, 'trait': False}
}
Note that the csv file only has the trait (observable).
As we are looping through various scenarios, consider the following call to joint_probablity
joint_probablity(people, {"Harry"}, {"James"}, {"James"})
What are you asked to calculate?
The joint probability of;
Harry having one gene (P(gene=1)) and
James having two genes P(gene=2) and
James showing the trait P(trait=yes) and
Lily not having any genes P(gene=0) and
Lily not showing trait (P(trait=no)) and
Harry not showing trait P(trait=no)
Better to group them by persons:

Harry having one gene and not showing trait
James having two genes and showing the trait
Lily having 0 genes and not showing the trait
ORDER does not matter.

Lily:
p(a and b) = p(a | b) * p(b) = .99 * .96 = 0.9504

James:
P(show trait and two genes) = P(show trait given two genes) * p (two genes) = .65 * .01 = .0065

Harry:
one gene and not showing the trait.
first, calculate one gene:
    Two ways. Get the gene from Lily and not from James OR get the gene from James and not from Lily
    You can add the above two (since it is OR)
    get the gene from lily and not from James
        Lily has 0. with mutation .01
        James has 2 1 * .01 = .01
        .01 * .01 = 0.0001
    get from james and not from lily
        1 * .99 = .99
        1 * .99 = .99
        .99 * .99 = .9801
    .01 + .9801 = 0.9802

    0.9802

Harry not showig trait:
 P(trait=false and gene=1) = p(trait = false given gene=1) * p(gene=1)
                            = .44

    .9802 * .44 = 0.431288

Then multiply everything.
0.9504 * .0065 * 0.431288 = 0.002664
