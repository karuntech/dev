# Analysis

## Layer 4, Head 10

Layer 4, head 10 appears to focus on the determiner and the noun that follows it. 
For example "the room" and "a box" from my example sentences that I tried.

Example Sentences:
- He opened the [MASK] and entered the room. 
    The model produced "He opened the door and entered the room"
- She bought a box full of [MASK] from the bakery
    The model produced "She bought a box full of cookies from the bakery"

## Layer 4, Head 6

Layer 4, head 6 appears to pay attention to the word that preceeds it. For example in the sentence There are eleven players in the [MASK] team
the word "are" was paying attention to "there" and the word "eleven" was paying attention to "are"

Example Sentences:
- There are eleven players in the [MASK] team
    The model produced "There are eleven players in the national team"
- It was [MASK] all day yesterday
    The model produced "It was raining all day yesterday"
